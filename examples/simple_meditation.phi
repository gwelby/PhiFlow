// simple_meditation.phi - Basic PhiFlow Example
// A simple meditation sequence through phi-harmonic frequencies

// Start at ground state - foundation frequency
INITIALIZE ground_center AT 432Hz WITH {
  coherence: 1.0,
  purpose: "Establish stable foundation for meditation"
}

// Move to creation frequency - manifestation
TRANSITION TO love_frequency AT 528Hz WITH {
  phi_level: 1,
  intent: "Open heart to divine love"
}

// Ascend to unity consciousness
EVOLVE TO unity_field AT 768Hz WITH {
  phi_level: 3,
  resonance: "Perfect toroidal balance",
  field_integrity: "Complete quantum coherence"
}

// Return to grounded state with wisdom
RETURN TO grounded_wisdom AT 432Hz WITH {
  compression: 0.618, // Golden ratio compression
  coherence: 0.95,
  state: "Integrated and peaceful"
}
