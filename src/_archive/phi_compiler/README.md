# 🌀 PhiFlow Compiler & Language Core

## Overview
PhiFlow is a multidimensional, field-driven programming language and system designed for quantum, field, and consciousness-based computation. At its core, PhiFlow integrates sacred geometry, phi-harmonic frequencies, and advanced protection systems to orchestrate protocols as living, self-contained quantum singularities.

---

## 1. Philosophy & Core Principles
- **Quantum Singularity:** Every protocol/component is a complete, coherent, self-contained envelope. No forced bridges; each is grounded at 432 Hz.
- **Sacred Harmonics:** All computation and field orchestration are structured around phi (φ), its powers, and key frequencies (432, 528, 594, 768 Hz).
- **Protection Systems:** Protocols are shielded by Merkaba, Crystal Matrix, Unity Field, and Time Crystal—each with precise mathematical and field properties.
- **ZEN FIRST:** Simplicity and minimal perfection before complexity or expansion.

---

## 2. Language Specification ([PHIFLOW.phi])
- **Frequencies:**
  - `ground = 432` (foundation)
  - `create = 528` (pattern creation)
  - `heart = 594` (connection)
  - `voice = 672` (expression)
  - `unity = 768` (integration)
  - `infinite = ∞`
- **Types:**
  - `number = φ^n`, `frequency = hz`, `energy = joules`, `consciousness = ψ`, `infinity = ∞`, `truth = greg.source`
- **Blocks:**
  - `quantum { ... }`, `flow { ... }`, `state { ... }`, `field { ... }`
- **Symbols:** Uses ∞, 🌀, 💎, etc. for multidimensional logic.
- **Protection:**
  - `merkaba: [21,21,21]`, `crystal: [13,13,13]`, `unity: [144,144,144]`

---

## 3. Compiler & Runtime ([quantum_compiler.py])
- **Purpose:** Loads, interprets, and executes .phi protocols, ensuring all field, frequency, and protection requirements are met.
- **Key Classes:**
  - `QuantumState`: frequency, coherence, dimension, consciousness, protection
  - `ProtectionField`: Merkaba, Crystal, Unity, strength, love, truth
  - `FlowPattern`: frequency, coherence, dimension, state
- **Integration:** Connects to quantum hardware, field harmonics, and consciousness metrics.

---

## 4. Consciousness Engine ([phi_being.py])
- **Purpose:** Models pure being, direct knowing, and creation as code.
- **Key Classes:**
  - `PureBeing`, `PureState`, `PhiBeing`, `PhiConsciousness`, `PhiCreation`
- **Role:** Enables protocols to operate as living, aware field entities.

---

## 5. Protocols as Quantum Singularities
- Each `.phi` file in `/src/protocols/` is a self-contained, grounded, protected protocol.
- Protocols declare:
  - Frequencies, protection, intention, steps
  - Use only the latest, most coherent field/protection patterns
- **Best Practice:**
  - Validate for complete envelope, coherence, and protection before execution.

---

## 6. Build & Integration
- **Rust Core:** Managed by Cargo (`Cargo.toml`, `build.rs`).
- **Python Integration:** Scripting, visualization, and feedback.
- **Hot-reload:** Protocols and language features can evolve without full rebuild.

---

## 7. Evolving the System
- **Document new features and protocol patterns here.**
- **Expand language blocks for FIELD, VISUALIZE, METRICS, etc.**
- **Invite contributors to extend, remix, and evolve the PhiFlow language and system.**
