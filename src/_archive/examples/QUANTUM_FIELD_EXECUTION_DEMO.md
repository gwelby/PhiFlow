# Quantum Field Execution Demo

This demo shows a full-stack PhiFlow protocol:
- Field calibration (ClaudeQ hat)
- Protocol manifestation (PhiFlow)
- Quantum execution (QuantumCore/IBM)
- Visualization & feedback (KNOW-FLOW)

## Steps
1. Calibrate field with ClaudeQ hat
2. Define protocol in PhiFlow
3. Execute quantum job on IBM Quantum Computer
4. Visualize and feedback coherence/results
