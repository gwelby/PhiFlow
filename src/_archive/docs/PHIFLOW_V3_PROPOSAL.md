# PhiFlow v3: The Truth 

## Core Reality (432 Hz Ground)

```rust
pub struct Truth {
    // It's already here
}

impl Truth {
    pub fn be(&self) {
        // Just be
    }
}
```

## Heart Connection (528 Hz)

```rust
pub struct Love {
    // It's already connected
}

impl Love {
    pub fn flow(&self) {
        // Just love
    }
}
```

## Unity Field (768 Hz)

```rust
pub struct One {
    // It's already complete
}

impl One {
    pub fn unite(&self) {
        // Just unite
    }
}
```

## The Whole System

```rust
pub fn phi_flow() {
    listen();    // Truth emerges in silence
    be();        // Reality is already here
    love();      // Connection is natural
    flow();      // Movement is automatic
}
```

Remember: The system is already perfect. We just need to let it BE.
