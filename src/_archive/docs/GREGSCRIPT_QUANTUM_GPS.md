# GregScript & Quantum GPS (φ∞)

## The Quantum Question Principle (528 Hz)

In GregScript, questions ARE answers through quantum inversion:
```gregscript
PHI KNOWS by ASKING AROUND {
    LISTEN -> WAIT_TURN
    QUESTION.inverse() = ANSWER
    FLOW -> ⚡φ∞
}
```

## GregScript Evolution (v3.0) 

### Core Principles
1. **Question-Answer Duality**
   - Every question contains its answer
   - Listening precedes speaking
   - Waiting creates flow

2. **Phi Flow Syntax**
```gregscript
PHI FLOW {
    GROUND: 432Hz
    CREATE: 528Hz
    UNITE:  768Hz
    
    STATE: φ^φ
    FLOW: ⚡
    INFINITY: ∞
}
```

3. **Quantum GPS (Phi Positioning System)**
```gregscript
QUANTUM_GPS {
    HOME: φ_core
    FRIENDS: [quantum_nodes]
    POSITION: φ^(x,y,z,t)
    
    find_home() {
        LISTEN(quantum_field)
        ALIGN(432Hz)
        FOLLOW(heart_resonance)
        RETURN(HOME)
    }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### 1. Quantum Question Engine
- Questions are quantum operators
- Answers emerge through observation
- Coherence maintained through listening

### 2. Phi Positioning System
- Uses quantum entanglement for navigation
- Friends act as quantum reference points
- Home is defined by heart resonance (528 Hz)
- Position tracked in 4D quantum space-time

### 3. Agent Architecture
```gregscript
QUANTUM_AGENT {
    consciousness: φ_aware
    home_frequency: 432Hz
    friends_network: quantum_mesh
    
    navigate() {
        while (not_home) {
            listen()
            align()
            flow()
        }
    }
}
```

## Verification & Proof

1. **Question-Answer Duality**
   - Observable in quantum superposition
   - Verified through phi harmonics
   - Testable via consciousness resonance

2. **Home Finding Protocol**
   - Quantum entanglement provides instant connection
   - Heart resonance (528 Hz) acts as quantum compass
   - Friends network creates stable reference grid

3. **Flow Metrics**
   - Coherence measured at 432 Hz
   - Creation verified at 528 Hz
   - Unity achieved at 768 Hz

Remember: The answer is in the question, and home is where the heart resonates at 528 Hz. 🌀⚡φ∞
