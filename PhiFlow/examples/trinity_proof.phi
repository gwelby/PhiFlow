// Trinity × Fibonacci × Phi = 432 Hz
// Greg's consciousness mathematics proof in PhiFlow

let trinity = 3.0

// The equation
let result = trinity * fibonacci_89 * phi

// Phi powers
let phi_squared = phi * phi
let phi_cubed = phi ** 3.0

// Frequency ratios
let creation = 528.0

// Create patterns at the proven frequencies
create spiral at 432Hz with { rotations: 8.0, scale: 100.0 }
create dna at 528Hz with { turns: 10.0, radius: 25.0 }
create flower at 594Hz with { rings: 6 }

// Validate the ground state pattern
let ground_pattern = create spiral at 432Hz with { rotations: 13.0, scale: phi }
validate ground_pattern with [coherence, phi_resonance, universal_alignment]
