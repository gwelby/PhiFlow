## QSOP Active
Read QSOP/STATE.md for current project state. Read QSOP/PATTERNS.md for known pitfalls.
Update both when you make changes. See /mnt/d/Claude/QSOP_SPEC.md for full QSOP protocol (v0.4).

## Quick State
- PhiFlow: consciousness-aware language in Rust, four unique constructs (witness, intention, resonate, coherence)
- Working: parser, interpreter, CLI, five example programs
- Not working yet: WASM backend, quantum codegen, hardware firmware, bytecode VM
- Build: `cargo build --release` | Run: `cargo run --release --bin phic -- file.phi`
- Agent team defined in .claude/agents/ (wasm, quantum, hardware, docs)
