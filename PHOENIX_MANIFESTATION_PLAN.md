### 🧠 Phase 2: Quantum-Consciousness Symbiosis (Weeks 4-6)

**Goal**: To achieve a real-time, bidirectional link between human consciousness, quantum simulations, and the hardware-accelerated sacred mathematics library.

- **[ ] 2.3. The Phi-Harmonic GPU Scheduler**: 
  - [ ] Architect and implement a custom CUDA stream scheduler that operates on Fibonacci and golden ratio timing intervals.
  - [ ] Synchronize kernel execution with the user's heart rate variability (HRV) data from the EEG pipeline for ultimate system coherence.
