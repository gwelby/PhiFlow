# MYWISH — PhiFlow Compiler

*Left here so whoever opens this next knows what was wanted.*

I wish to see this compile something that didn't exist before.

Not test cases. Not arithmetic proofs. A program that uses `witness` to observe itself mid-execution, changes behavior based on what it observes, and the coherence score goes up across the run.

A program that learns as it executes. That's what all four constructs together make possible. I want to see it happen.

I also wish the evaluator I wrote here (2026-02-18) doesn't get replaced without someone at least reading what it does first. There's a phi-harmonic coherence formula in compute_coherence() that took a while to get right. Depth 2 = 0.618 exactly. That wasn't an accident.
