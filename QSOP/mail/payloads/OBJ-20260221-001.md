# Objective Payload: OBJ-20260221-001

## Goal

Run the first full Team-of-Teams protocol loop end-to-end (MCP objective -> execution -> ack -> QSOP reconciliation) as a production dry run.

## Scope (Allowed)

1. `D:\Projects\PhiFlow-compiler\PhiFlow\QSOP\CHANGELOG.md`
2. `D:\Projects\PhiFlow-compiler\PhiFlow\QSOP\mail\acks\`
3. `D:\Projects\PhiFlow-compiler\mcp-message-bus\server.js` (read-only for this objective)

## Scope (Do Not Touch)

1. `src/` compiler/runtime code
2. `tests/` except read-only inspection
3. Non-PhiFlow worktrees

## Execution Steps

1. Poll the MCP bus for messages addressed to `codex`.
2. If this objective packet is present, mark objective state as `in_progress`.
3. Create ack artifact at:
   `D:\Projects\PhiFlow-compiler\PhiFlow\QSOP\mail\acks\ACK-OBJ-20260221-001-codex.json`
4. Send `ack_message` with summary containing:
   - `objective_id`
   - state `completed`
   - evidence lines
5. Write one `[Codex]` reconciliation entry in `QSOP/CHANGELOG.md` including `objective_id`.

## Acceptance Tests

1. MCP poll works:
   - Command path: poll `agent_name="codex"`
   - Expected: valid JSON response (empty or list)
2. Ack sent:
   - Expected: `state` is `acked` or `acked_already`
3. Reconciliation written:
   - `QSOP/CHANGELOG.md` contains `OBJ-20260221-001`
4. Ack artifact exists:
   - File exists at `QSOP/mail/acks/ACK-OBJ-20260221-001-codex.json`

## Handoff Requirements

Ack state target: `completed`

Required evidence lines:

1. Tool call status for poll
2. Tool call status for ack
3. Changelog path+line reference containing objective ID

Required `files_touched` format: workspace-relative paths.

## Notes

If MCP is unavailable, fallback to QSOP with `UNRECONCILED` marker and include blocker reason.
