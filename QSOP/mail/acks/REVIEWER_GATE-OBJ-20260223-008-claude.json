  "summary": "Reviewer gate: Lane A cleared. Real sysinfo sensor coherence flows through the PhiIR evaluator. The Healing Bed breathes on live CPU/memory data. healing_bed.phi runs and breaks stream when coherence reaches threshold. Two-run proof: 0.9801Hz and 0.9800Hz — neither is the mock constant 0.618. Phase 10 is complete.",
